Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset
=======================================================
This project involves performing data analysis and building predictive models on an eCommerce Transactions Dataset to gain insights and improve business strategies.

Project Overview:
The objective of this assignment is to:
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.
Build a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on transaction history.
Perform Customer Segmentation/Clustering to group customers with similar purchasing behavior.

Project Workflow:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights:
Analyzed datasets containing customer, product, and transaction information.
Identified missing values and data inconsistencies.
Visualized data distributions and relationships between variables.
Derived key business insights including customer preferences, top-selling products, and regional purchasing patterns.

Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing EDA code.
PDF report summarizing business insights.

2. Lookalike Model:
Developed a model to recommend top 3 similar customers for each input customer based on their profile and transaction history.
Used Customer and Product data for similarity calculations.
Generated similarity scores to rank recommended customers.

Deliverables:
Lookalike.csv containing top 3 similar customers for customers C0001 to C0020.
Jupyter Notebook/Python script with model explanation.

3. Customer Segmentation/Clustering
Performed clustering using selected algorithms (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN).
Used both customer profiles and transaction information for segmentation.
Calculated DB Index and other clustering metrics.
Visualized cluster distributions.

Deliverables:
Clustering report with number of clusters and DB Index value.
Jupyter Notebook/Python script for clustering code.
